        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Butter Chicken also known as Chicken Makhani is a classic 
        Indian dish that's made by simmering marinated and grilled 
        chicken (Tandoori chicken) in a spicy, aromatic, buttery and 
        creamy tomato gravy. This lip-smacking and delicious dish is 
        hugely popular among the Indian food lovers across the world.</p>

        <p>It is believed that Butter Chicken was invented during 
        1930 to 1935, by Kundan Lal Jaggi & Kundan Lal Gujral, 
        the owners/partners of a restaurant named Moti Mahal in 
        Delhi, India. The restaurant would usually have large 
        orders of tandoori chicken but sometimes ended up with 
        leftovers which were dry. Butter Chicken was a way to 
        use up the leftover dry Tandoori Chicken. The large pieces 
        of grilled chicken were diced and simmered in a rich creamy 
        and buttery tomato gravy. That's how Murgh Makhani - 
        Chicken Makhani came into existence.</p>
